# Basic Phone

A simple home screen that does what you need.

Simplify how you call family and friends, respond to missed calls and other common tasks. Large icons open directly to the most useful part of a given app, skipping confusing UIs and unnecessary button clicks. Basic Phone is designed so that seniors and the visually impaired can get the most out of their smartphones.

### In 1-2 clicks you can
- Call your favorite contacts
- Return a missed call
- Get driving directions to your home
- Order an Uber back to your home
- Listen to your favorite music
- Set reminders
- And more!

On first load, please install and configure all of that apps that you wish to use. We selected apps that are simple, useful and free or ad supported. Basic Phone itself is completely free! You can optionally customize the app with some personal details (home address, preferred homepage and music preference) and the data is stored locally on device, never uploaded.

READ_CALL_LOG and CALL_PHONE permissions are used to display missed calls and initiate new calls. CONTACTS and CAMERA permissions are needed to display your contacts and turn on the flashlight.
