# Basic Phone

A simple home screen that does what you need in one click.

Basic Phone replaces your home screen with a simplified set of actions. Large icons open directly to the most useful part of the given app, skipping confusing UIs and unnecessary button clicks. Basic Phone was designed so that the elderly, the visually impaired and young children can get the most out of their devices.

#### In one click you can
- Call friends in your contact list
- Get driving directions to your home
- Order an Uber back to your home
- Search for your favorite music
- Listen to the news
- And more!

On first load, please install and configure all of that apps that you wish to use. We selected apps that are simple, useful and free or ad supported. Basic Phone itself is completely free! You can optionally customize the app with some personal details (home address, emergency contact and music preference) and the data is stored locally on device, never uploaded.
